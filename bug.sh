  # The error is that the script assumes all lines are valid integers, which is not guaranteed
  # What happens if the input file contains non-numeric data?
  # The script will produce unexpected behavior, likely due to the arithmetic comparison.
  # This type of bug can easily occur in shell scripts when handling user input or data from external files.
  # Robust error handling is crucial to avoid such issues. 
  # Consider adding validation to ensure that each input is a number
  # Check if the input is null, empty or not a number.
  #  And implement error handling to prevent the script from crashing in those cases.
